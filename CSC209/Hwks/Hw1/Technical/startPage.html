<p>The <a href="https://yuzfu.github.io/CSC209-Github/CSC209/Hwks/Hw1/Technical/spring2025Courses.html">website</a> contains all class informations that I am currently taking for the semester.</p>
the site should apply a few of the html concepts you encountered during the tutorial: headers, paragraphs, lists, tables, colors, style, images, links to other sites and links to files, etc.
