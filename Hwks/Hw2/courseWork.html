            <li>All homeworks and projects are hands-on coding.</li>
            <li>All students should expect to be asked to demonstrate their work in front of the class and answer questions about coding decisions that they made. </li>

        <h1>Midterm. Two parts: In-class and take-home</h1>
        <h2>30%</h2>
        <p>The midterm is a mini-project (i.e. will require the application of what you have learned up to the midterm week) and will be similar in complexity to the last homework before the midterm week.</p>

        <h1>Final project</h1>
        <h2>40%</h2>
        <p>The last three to four weeks of the semester are devoted to the final (group) project.</p>
