        <h1>Attendance policy</h1>
        <p>Attendance policy: class attendance is an intrinsic part of the educational process and you are required to attend and be active during class time. EXCEPTION: if you feel sick, have flu-like symptoms (even mild ones), please isolate, notify the professor via email that you will miss the class, and follow the College's protocol. Discuss with the professor, preferably via zoom, all class-related concerns and manners in which you can make up for missed work and get back to speed.</p>
        
        <h1>Lateness policy</h1>
        <p>Late homework will not be accepted. See details below under Coursework and Grading.</p>
