        "description": "In 1896, Smith trustees were astonished when the college was bequeathed a large sum of money from Eliza Appleton Haven. She was unknown to alumnae, faculty or trustees. Equally surprised were some of her family members, who contested her will. It is believed that Ms. Haven wished to demonstrate her support for the education of women. Her generosity allowed Smith to purchase two houses along Elm Street, which are now&nbsp;known as Haven\/Wesley, They&nbsp;provide housing for 71 Smith students.\nAlthough composed of two buildings, the complex is strongly unified. Residents are said to have the best location on campus, since the houses are close to both Neilson Library and the Campus Center.&nbsp;\nThere are a total of 25 single rooms and 23 double rooms in the two houses. Part of the houses\u2019 charm lies in the unusual architectural features in many of the rooms: some have sloping ceilings and odd-shaped windows, while others have odd-shaped closets or private porches. Each house has coin-operated washers and dryers in the basement.\nOne of the particular appeals of the Haven\/Wesley complex is that each house has an extensive living room with a piano. Wesley has two study rooms as well. The complex is rich in tradition, with an annual Halloween Haunted House and two cocktail parties on winter and spring weekends. Other activities include \u201cCovert Cupids,\u201d Big Sib-Little Sib and the Senior Banquet. There is even an annual nontalent show!\nHavenites and Wesleyites pride themselves on living in a diverse and spirited house. Haven, which is bright yellow, is one of the most attractive houses on campus. On autumn and spring days, residents can be found on Haven\u2019s porch swing talking and enjoying the weather.\nHaven\/Wesley is also notable because writer Sylvia Plath lived there while a student at Smith.",

Downtown Northampton is a five-minute walk.\nWashburn House was built by Smith in 1878 to house the incoming class of 1882.

From 1933 to 1938, it was a cooperative house, and residents performed all the household chores. During the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339)&nbsp;it served as the Spanish-speaking house on campus, as it was not possible to send&nbsp;students to Spain for academic study.\nPast residents of Washburn have remained devoted to their college home&nbsp;and have returned to Smith to celebrate significant reunions. Former Washburn residents presented Washburn with a 400-book collection on the house\u2019s 50th birthday.",

        "description": "Scales House is one of the 10 houses of \"the quad,\" which form a semicircle and enclose a small courtyard. This is also the site of the \"diploma circle\" where graduates distribute their diplomas during Commencement.\nThe complex was built in stages starting in 1922, to alleviate a housing shortage on campus. When all the houses were completed in 1936, William Allan Neilson, then president of Smith, pronounced it the \"Great Quadrangle.\"\nScales and its sister house, King, were built in 1935 and 1936. Laura Scales was named after Laura Woolsey Lord Scales of the class of 1901. Scales was Smith's first dean of students, a post that she held for 22 years.",

With these secured, he could carry out his plan to make every student a campus resident of Smith College. Before this, the college had a shortage of housing facilities,&nbsp;and students had to find living arrangements on their own.&nbsp;\nToday only one of the original houses remains. Hopkins, one of Smith's significant historical buildings, was built as a private residence in 1861.\nHopkins is one of two small cooperative houses. The 18 student residents&nbsp;buy food collectively and cook communally for the majority of house meals, which receive rave reviews from \"Hopkids\" and the many friends, family members and professors who frequently join in house dinners and potlucks. All residents share in cleaning and maintaining the house, and they govern the house collectively through a weekly house meeting. The house elects a food coordinator and treasurer to manage food purchasing and communal funds and also has a house coordinator who fulfills traditional residential life duties in the house. Hopkins residents participate in a close-knit house community, applying ideals of sustainability and social justice to their daily lives. The house cultivates relationships with local farms, timebanks, cooperatives and workshares, and all residents participate actively in making decisions about running the house and defining the house community's character and goals. Hopkins is open to all students except first-years and strives to maintain a balance of sophomores, juniors and seniors.",
